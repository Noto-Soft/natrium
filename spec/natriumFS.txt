NatriumFS v1

Block = 2 512b sectors

Boot block: Block 0 (Sectors 0-1)
Superblock: Block 1 (Sectors 2-3)
Root directory: Block 2-5 (Sectors 4-11) (4 blocks)
Data blocks: Block 6-[size of disk in kb - 1] (Sectors 12-[size of disk in kb/2 - 1])

Superblock layout:
16 byte volume name padded with spaces
1 byte for NatriumFS version (should be 0x01 for v1)
1 word for the next free block
Rest of block reserved

Directory block(s) layout:
byte for max directory entries (can be up to 255), 31 zero bytes to align to 32 bytes
Repeated 32 byte entries until blocks run out

Root directory will always have 127 max entries

Entry layout:
16 bytes name, no zero terminator, padded with spaces
Word for file starting block, byte for how many blocks to load, attribute byte
Word for padding length (how many zeroes added to expand it to a 1kb block). Probably useful for something. You can subtract this from the file size * 1024 to get the actual byte size of the file.
10 zero bytes for aligning to 32 bytes
If the first byte of the name is 0 then assume the file entry is free

attribute byte: (or'd together)
~0x80 - Normal file (anything without the highest bit set)
0x01 - System file
0x80 - Directory (anything with the highest bit set)
Rest reserved

Subdirectories:
Check for a file with the attribute 0x80 and the name of the directory you're searching for. It shouldn't have a period in the name but it can if you want
Load the entire directory into memory in a safe buffer, this buffer needs to be 8kb to fit the max directory entries. Also never trust the file size directly and if it's greater than 8 blocks, set it to 8 blocks.
Now you can loop through this directory buffer for whatever file you want from it
