executables (.exe) files get passed the current working directory name as well as the drive number in es:bp and dl respectively (bp is zero if root)
es:si also contains the arguments to the program if any (si will be zero if none)
if you plan on doing complex parsing of arguments load the arguments into a buffer of length 256 (stop loading when you encounter a zero)

executables are always loaded at the offset 0 in the segment
